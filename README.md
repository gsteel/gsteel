### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Georgeâ€¦ I mostly do PHP and I have a small web design and development firm in the UK called "[Net Glue](https://github.com/netglue)".

I like to work with [Laminas](https://github.com/laminas) and [Mezzio](https://github.com/mezzio) components most and you can often find me making client websites using the Prismic headless CMS.

I'm not very available for hire because I'm pretty busy, but you're always welcome to ask. I can be reached via my company website at https://netglue.uk
